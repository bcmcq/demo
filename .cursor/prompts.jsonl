{"at":"2026-02-07T00:00:00Z","text":"I've got a eval project to complete. I would like to make a plan to tackle everything before I get started.\n\nTaking into account the following files:\n@INSTRUCTIONS.md \n@README.md \n@ADVANCED_TASKS.md \n\nI've already got the project setup and I'm to the stage of starting to work on building things out.\n\nMy initial thoughts:\n- For the AI usage report deliverable, I would like to track some fun facts about AI use (cursor, claude, etc) and also implement some type of commenting in the code so I can track stats and then create a shell or artisan command to spit out a report. Something along those lines, let's discuss this point and come up with a fun solution. I've already created a mdc rule for cursor that will log everytime I submit a prompt.\n- For the advanced tasks, I'm thinking I tackle:\n  - A:1, A:3 & maybe (A:4, A:5 or A:6) - let's confirm 1 and 3 and add placeholders for 4, 5 and 6 we can plan later.\n  - B:8 (maybe B:9 or B:10 - add placeholders)\n- Note the \"What to build\" section \"NOTE: Feel free to break out of the Advanced Task Menu items. The opportunities are endless here, feel free to use your imagination to do something you feel fits and will show off your skills.\" -- if you have suggestions of something else that might be cool to integrate.","model":"claude-4.6-opus-high-thinking"}
