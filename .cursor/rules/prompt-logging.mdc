# Prompt logging

When the user sends a prompt in this project, the FIRST thing you must do is:

**Append the prompt to the log**
Append one line to `.cursor/prompts.jsonl`. Each line is a single JSON object with:
- `at`: ISO 8601 timestamp (e.g. `2025-02-06T12:00:00Z`)
- `text`: the exact prompt text (escape newlines as `\n` so the log stays one JSON object per line)
- `model`: the model identifier for this response when known; otherwise `null`

Example line:
```json
{"at":"2025-02-06T14:30:00Z","text":"Add a test for the new controller","model":"claude-sonnet-4"}
```

Do this at the start of your response, before any other work. If the user's message is empty or only a follow-up (e.g. "yes", "go ahead") you may skip logging. Do not log system messages or your own text—only the user's prompt.

Total prompt count = number of lines in the JSONL file (e.g. `wc -l .cursor/prompts.jsonl`).
